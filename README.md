I like podcasts but making them is a pain. This will (eventually) be an automagic podcast generator using a load of CSV tweets from [this goat](http://twitter.com/adr_ebooks)

So

* Process CSV
* Pick 10-20-30-40/whatever random tweet texts from CSV
* Run some sort of text to speech on them

ok?

TODO:
* Make it so it's just goat tweets and not @ replies
* backing track
* auto uploader?
* better voice?
